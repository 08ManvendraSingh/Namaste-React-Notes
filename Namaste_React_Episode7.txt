						Namaste React Episode 7
					---------------------------------------

1.How to use React Router Dom?
--> First we have to download react router dom package from npm, by using npm i react-router-dom command.
--> After that we have to create a configuration and for creating configuration we have import createBrowserRouter from react-router-dom.
--> createBrowserRouter takes an configuration and it takes an array of objects.
--> Each object defines a path and what happens on that path. 
    for example {
		  path:'/',
	          element:<Body/>,
		}, // this tells that if path was '/' then load Body component.

--> Next thing is to provide this configuration so that it render's on screen and for that we have import RouterProvider from react-router-dom.
--> If anyone trys to access any random path, react-router-dom creates an error page for that. 


2.Why not to use Anchor tag?
--> when navigate from one route to another route don't use anchor tag cos it will relaod the whole page.
    So for that react-router-dom gives us an Link component to do this without reloading the page.  

3.What is Single Page Application(SAP)?
--> React apps are spa.
--> SPA will not reload the page , it will not make network call when we are changing page. It will interchanged the components.

4.Different types of routing?
--> 1. Server side routing :
       In server side routing all the page are come for server.
       for example: We have different page such as home.html , about.html so it makes the network call and gets the data and then reload the whole page.

    2. Client side routing :
       In client side routing it's doesn't make an network call , it interchaged the components accirding to url. That's why it is single page application.
